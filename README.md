That's a simple program made exclusively for this file.
I found some Height and Weight report from the internet and decided to calculate the BMI.
Although the mean Height is pretty normal (1.72m),
  the BMI is pretty weird, because more than a half of the distribution is in "normal weight" category, literally no one is above it and a lot of people are under it.
This can tell us two things: The data I found is unreliable (probable) or It's from a slim people region (like east asia)
